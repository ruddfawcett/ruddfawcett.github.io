The Soviet Union did not publicly acknowledge the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster'>Chernobyl disaster</a> until April 29, 1986â€”three days after the partial meltdown of Reactor No. 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on April 26. Newspapers around the world reported on the event.

This photo essay presents Chernobyl-related imagery from the front pages of the "papers of record" of the four countries with the most nuclear reactors in 1986, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency: the United States (The New York Times), 101; the Soviet Union (Pravda), 50; France (Le Monde), 43; Britain (The Times), 38. The work interrogates truth amongst crisis, ownership of information, and accountability of news media.
